				<img class="floatleft" src="assets/images/index.jpg" alt="placeholder image">
				<h3 class="arialfont">Hello!  My name is Czarina J. Lee.</h3>
					<p class="arialfont">I'm an aspiring full-stack developer, part-time coding boot camp student, and full-time coffee shop manager.  During my ten years of management, I've developed a number of skills including the ability to work under pressure, identify opportunities and gaps, problem solve, and work together with a diverse group of people and personalities.  I am quickly learning that these skills are extremely useful in my pursuit of becoming a web developer.  In fact, I tapped into a few of them while creating my first project--this bio page!</p>
				<h3 class="arialfont">Let's get personal.</h3>
					<p class="arialfont">I was born and raised in San Francisco, California (which explains my affinity for walking up and down hills, taking public transit anywhere, and composting and recycling properly).  I married my best friend in July 2015, and one short year later our beautiful daughter was born.  Although the food service and retail industry have been very supportive of my new family, I wanted to explore other career options.  I took an intro programming course in college and enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of it.  I find it rewarding to create something from nothing and to see a project through to completion.  I also know that there is a high demand for developers especially in the Bay Area.  I'm excited to see what new opportunities a career in coding will bring my family and me.</p>
